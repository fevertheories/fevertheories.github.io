###Why?

Vanity.

I have read more books than what I should have and this is my chance to give something back to humanity.

During the last decade I spent many days and nights alone, lying sick with fever on a bed, unable to do anything else but use my mind to let time pass.

Having nothing better to think about, I developed my fever theories. These theories try to explain many everyday things that we take for granted and nobody cares or dares to provide an explanation.

I understand that most likely you will find these theories insulting and racist. If you are a real scientist there is a good chance that you will find them absurd too.

Nevertheless, my intentions are 100% pure good, since all I try to do is to answer why some things happen in life. My only axiom that I take for granted is that the single power that drives life is survival, since this is what life is. Which brings us to the survival of the fittest and the theory of evolution. So every single theory of mine originates on the premise that things happen in order to survive by gaining an advantage over one's peers in their environment.

Also I believe that only inferior minds can feel insulted, as a result of their inability to face the truth in the mirror. The truth that stupidity is out there, expanding rapidly out in the open. Probably because stupidity makes survival easier.

Finally, please do remember that this literally is a product of a sick mind.
